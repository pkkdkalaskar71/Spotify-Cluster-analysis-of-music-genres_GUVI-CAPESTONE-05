# Project Title :- Clustering music genres using python
# Technologies :- Descriptive statistics, Python, Data retrieval, Data visualization
# Domain :- Machine learning


# Problem Statement:
It is challenging for users to find and explore new music due to the millions of songs from various genres that are available on music streaming services. The manual classification of music into genres can be a laborious and error-prone process. Automating this procedure and grouping songs into related genres based on their audio features is possible with the help of machine learning algorithms.
This project's goal is to create a machine learning model that can automatically group musical genres based on audio features like tempo, beats per minute, melody, timbre. By making it simpler for users to discover and explore new music, the model should be able to accurately group songs into genres that are similar. This will enhance the user experience of music streaming platforms. The project should also explore different clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN, and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.


# Approach:
## 1. Feature Extraction:-
It's crucial to extract from the audio recordings the relevant features first. Rhythm, speed, pitch, and timbre are common characteristics of different musical genres.
## 2. Data preparation:-
After features have been retrieved, it is crucial to preprocess the data so that it is ready for clustering. This could entail scaling, normalisation, or other data modifications.
## 3. Dimensionality reduction:-
Because working with high-dimensional data can be challenging, it is frequently beneficial to make the feature space less dimensional. Techniques for dimensionality reduction that are often employed include Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are commonly used techniques for dimensionality reduction.
## 4. Clustering Algorithms:-
K-means, Hierarchical Clustering are a few clustering techniques that can be employed for this project. Based on the features of the data and the desired result, it is crucial to select the right algorithm.
## 5. Visualization:-
Ultimately, in order to understand the data and successfully communicate the findings, it is crucial to visualize the clusters. For this, methods like dendograms and scatter plots can be applied.
## 6. Experimentation:-
To identify the best clustering solution feasible, it is crucial to experiment with various algorithms, feature sets, and preprocessing strategies. Comparing the outcomes of various methods can assist in identifying the most effective technology.


# Results:
This project's goal is to create a machine learning model that can automatically group musical genres based on audio features like tempo, beats per minute, melody, timbre. Visualize the clusters based on some of the audio features.
